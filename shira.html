        <h3> llama </h3>
      I used to live on the upper east side of ny and this park was right next to my aprtment. I used to go on the camel every day. Long after I moved to Long Island, one day, I went to the city with some friends, including Etta, and we visited my old hometown. My friends forced me to take a  picture with the camel haha.
